# ðŸ§  Purple Threat Sim Campaign 001

This is a hands-on purple team lab project simulating a basic red team intrusion with matching detections. Itâ€™s built to demonstrate full-chain understanding of attacker behaviors and SOC-level detection strategy.

## ðŸ”´ Red Team Techniques
- AMSI Bypass via .NET Reflection
- Encoded PowerShell Loader
- NtCreateThreadEx Shellcode Injection

## ðŸ”µ Blue Team Responses
- SIGMA detection for PowerShell abuse
- NTDLL patching catch
- TTP-based detection aligned with MITRE

## ðŸ“š Artifacts
- Payload scripts and C stubs
- Matching SIGMA rules
- Attack chain documentation

Built by Keys â€” because why wait for permission to simulate the threats yourself?
